# Phase 3: Advanced Genomic Visualizations

This phase covers complex visualizations found in ProteinPaint and GenomePaint.

## Tutorials

### 3.1 UMAP/t-SNE Scatter Plot
Visualize high-dimensional single-cell or sample data.

### 3.2 Gene Expression Heatmap with Clustering
Build hierarchically clustered heatmaps with dendrograms.

### 3.3 Kaplan-Meier Survival Curves
Implement survival analysis visualizations with R integration.

### 3.4 Volcano Plot for Differential Expression
Visualize statistical significance vs effect size.

### 3.5 Oncoprint/Mutation Matrix
Display mutation patterns across samples like cBioPortal.

## Prerequisites
- Phase 1 & 2 completion
- Basic statistics knowledge
- Understanding of gene expression data

## Learning Outcomes
By completing this phase, you will be able to:
- Build high-performance scatter plots for large datasets
- Implement clustering and dendrogram visualization
- Create publication-quality survival analysis plots
- Design interactive mutation pattern matrices
