# Phase 3: Advanced Genomic Visualizations

This phase covers complex visualizations found in ProteinPaint and GenomePaint.

## Tutorials

### [3.1 UMAP/t-SNE Scatter Plot](01-scatter-plot/README.md)

Visualize high-dimensional single-cell or sample data.

### [3.2 Gene Expression Heatmap with Clustering](02-heatmap/README.md)

Build hierarchically clustered heatmaps with dendrograms.

### [3.3 Kaplan-Meier Survival Curves](03-survival-curves/README.md)

Implement survival analysis visualizations with R integration.

### [3.4 Volcano Plot for Differential Expression](04-volcano-plot/README.md)

Visualize statistical significance vs effect size.

### [3.5 Oncoprint/Mutation Matrix](05-oncoprint/README.md)

Display mutation patterns across samples like cBioPortal.

## Prerequisites

- Phase 1 & 2 completion
- Basic statistics knowledge
- Understanding of gene expression data

## Learning Outcomes

By completing this phase, you will be able to:

- Build high-performance scatter plots for large datasets
- Implement clustering and dendrogram visualization
- Create publication-quality survival analysis plots
- Design interactive mutation pattern matrices
